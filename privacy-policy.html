                        features that enable Travel Agents to share data with

                    <h3>Data Location</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your data is primarily stored on Amazon Web Services
                        (AWS) servers located in the Mumbai region, India.
                        Backup copies may be stored in other AWS regions for
                        disaster recovery purposes.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Security Measures</h3>
                    <p>
                        We implement industry-standard security measures
                        including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encryption of data in transit and at rest</li>
                        <li>Access controls and authentication mechanisms</li>
                        <li>Regular security audits and monitoring</li>
                        <li>Secure backup and disaster recovery procedures</li>
                        <li>Employee training on data protection</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        However, no method of transmission or storage is 100%
                        secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

                    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>

                    <p>
                        While we primarily operate within India, some of our
                        service providers (such as AWS) may involve
                        international data transfers for backup and disaster
                        recovery purposes. When such transfers occur, we ensure
                        appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your
                        data.
